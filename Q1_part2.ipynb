    "# Weather Prediction Dashboard Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to build a weather prediction system that will take in minute-by-minute data updates, aggregate this data into daily summaries, and use it for further prediction of weather conditions. The system will be implemented using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Streamlit**, and **Random Forest Models** to provide weather predictions for the next 21 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this system, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect new weather data every minute.\n",
    "2. Aggregate the minute-level data into daily summaries by calculating the mean for each feature.\n",
    "3. Update the main weather dataset with daily data.\n",
    "4. Display predictions interactively using **Streamlit** for better visualization and user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using **Streamlit**, the management team can easily interact with the predictions, view trends, and analyze weather data in a more engaging and intuitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps for Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Collection and Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Collection**: Each day, minute-by-minute weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and rain status) will be collected. This could be from an external weather API or sensor-based data collection.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Data Aggregation**: Since we cannot use minute-level data for predictions directly, we aggregate the data by calculating the **daily mean** for all features. This helps us to summarize the data without overwhelming the prediction system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how the data will be aggregated:\n",
    "- **Average Temperature**: Calculate the mean of the temperature values for the day.\n",
    "- **Humidity**: Calculate the mean humidity for the day.\n",
    "- **Wind Speed**: Calculate the mean wind speed for the day.\n",
    "- **Pressure**: Calculate the mean atmospheric pressure for the day.\n",
    "- **Rain Percentage**: Calculate the percentage of the time it rained during the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "This aggregation will allow us to ensure that we are working with a summary of the day’s data, which is more suitable for training prediction models and generating insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Updating the Main Weather Dataset (CSV)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the daily data is aggregated, we will update our main weather dataset (CSV file) with the new daily data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1**: We will first check if the CSV file exists. If it does, we will read it and append the new daily data. The new daily data will be the mean of the collected minute-level values for the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2**: If the CSV file doesn’t exist, we will create it with the necessary headers and store the first day's data (i.e., the aggregated mean values of temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and rain percentage).\n",
    "\n",
    "The script will look like this:\n"
